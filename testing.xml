         <section-text>
            <para>Paediatric abdominal pain is often a diagnostic dilemma. It is a common problem and, although the vast majority of these episodes are benign and self-limiting, persistent abdominal pain may signify an underlying pathology requiring urgent intervention. Timely assessment and intervention are critical in preventing untoward sequelae in children presenting with abdominal pain.</para>
            <para>Because of the spectrum of aetiologies that manifest as abdominal pain, the differential remains broad and diagnosis can be challenging. In most cases, a thorough history and physical examination can narrow the broad differential. However, depending on the age of the child, additional investigations may be required to delineate diseases that present with similar symptoms. Furthermore, even with the assistance of parents or guardians, a comprehensive history is often difficult to obtain, and diagnosis therefore relies heavily on the clinical acumen of the practitioner.</para>

            <para>The differential diagnoses for paediatric abdominal pain are broad and encompass almost every organ system. In addition, distinguishing acute from chronic abdominal pain may be particularly difficult in children. Although the most common aetiologies are not immediately life-threatening, the ability to diagnose urgent pathology remains paramount. A thorough history and physical examination are required to narrow the differential diagnosis, as well as an understanding of the more common diseases affecting the age group of the child in question.</para>

            <para>Assessment of paediatric abdominal pain can prove a diagnostic challenge. Children may be limited in their ability to give an accurate history. Parents or guardians may also have difficulty interpreting the complaints of small children. In many cases, the causes are benign with few long-term sequelae.

            <para>The clinician should determine early on whether the abdominal pain is acute or chronic in nature, as this will help indicate the urgency of treatment. Acute abdominal pain is usually a single episode that typically lasts from hours to days. The pain may vary in severity over time and is often localised and described as sharp and/or stabbing in nature. Conversely, chronic abdominal pain typically lasts days to weeks to months, and is usually dull, diffuse, and poorly localised. There may be pain-free intervals of variable duration, and when it recurs the pain may vary in intensity. In addition, the history should cover the following:</para>

In younger children, localisation of the abdominal pain may be difficult. Consideration of vital signs should be based on age-appropriate normal values. Because paediatric abdominal pain may originate from other areas of the body (e.g., genitals or lungs), a comprehensive physical examination is necessary, including performing a rectal examination and checking stool for occult blood (guaiac test).

            <para>Challenges in the clinical assessment of abdominal pain in the paediatric patient mean laboratory and imaging studies can play an important role. </para>
            <para>Initial tests should include an FBC (useful in assessing infection and inflammation) and complete chemistry panel (electrolyte disturbances associated with GI causes are common). Urinalysis is essential to exclude underlying UTI or haematuria (associated with nephrolithiasis, UTI, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, urinary tract or kidney injury) and should be performed in children of all ages presenting with abdominal pain. For females of reproductive age a urine pregnancy test and/or serum beta-hCG is necessary to exclude miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Type and screen is essential when a ruptured ectopic pregnancy is suspected, as the rhesus status of the mother determines the need for anti-D immunoglobulin administration. Liver function tests (LFTs) are helpful baseline investigations, when considering a hepatobiliary or pancreatic cause (e.g., viral hepatitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis). Serum amylase and lipase is indicated if pancreatitis is suspected. Although non-specific, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP) may suggest underlying infection or inflammation. Furthermore, these inflammatory markers correlate closely with disease activity in cases of inflammatory bowel disease.</para>
            <para>Stool microscopy and culture may be helpful in determining an infectious aetiology of gastroenteritis. Blood cultures are indicated when sepsis is a concern. Urine culture is necessary if urinalysis is suggestive of a UTI. Sputum culture is usually reserved for those patients with suspected pneumonia. Aspiration of frank pus on thoracentesis is diagnostic of empyema. In cases of peptic ulcer disease, <organism>Helicobacter pylori</organism> breath test or stool antigen test may be of use to determine whether a patient needs referral to a specialist if endoscopy is not readily available. Serological markers (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody) may be particularly useful for differentiating between CD and ulcerative colitis in the paediatric population. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) seen on wet mount of vaginal secretions confirms vaginal infection in cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In all patients with PID, it is important to screen for other STDs. Therefore, HIV serology, syphilis serology, hepatitis studies, and genetic probe or culture of vaginal secretions for <organism>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</organism> and <organism>Chlamydia trachomatis</organism> are indicated. In patients with suspected exposure to or symptoms of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, the following laboratory tests are warranted: hepatitis A antibody IgM, hepatitis B serology or viral load, hepatitis C serology or viral load, hepatitis D and E serologies. A coagulation profile, including prothrombin time (PT) and international normalised ratio (INR), is usually necessary in cases of suspected viral hepatitis to measure liver synthetic function.</para>

         <section-header>Imaging and other investigations</section-header>
         <section-text>
            <para>Imaging studies are guided by history and physical examination findings. Plain abdominal x-rays are often non-specific but may suggest the presence of an obstruction; faecal impaction can be detected on x-ray, <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-4.xml"/> as well as duodenal atresia. <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-6.xml"/> In addition, if sufficiently radio-opaque, it may be possible to identify gallstones <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-17.xml"/> or urinary stones on a plain abdominal film. This is often the initial test, as it can be performed quickly. Supine and upright films are usually requested. Free air under the diaphragm suggests perforation and requires immediate surgical assessment. Chest x-ray should be ordered if perforation is suspected or a respiratory cause such as pneumonia or empyema is likely.</para>
            <para>Ultrasound scans avoid radiation exposure and are typically better tolerated than other imaging modalities such as CT scan. An experienced paediatric radiologist may be able to utilise ultrasound in all regions of the body (abdomen, chest, testicles). Ultrasound scans are considered particularly useful in assessing pain in the RUQ (i.e., gallbladder disease), <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-16.xml"/> and lower abdominal pain (pelvic pain) in females. Colour Doppler may be helpful in determining ovarian blood flow in cases of suspected ovarian torsion. Testicular ultrasound (using power Doppler ultrasound and/or grey-scale ultrasound) should be able to diagnose testicular torsion and provide information on the vascular integrity of the testis. Ultrasound of the urinary tract (including kidneys) is of benefit when wanting to exclude anatomical abnormalities (e.g., when UTI is present) or nephrolithiasis and associated complications such as hydronephrosis.</para>
            <para>Focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) may be useful in children with blunt abdominal trauma who are haemodynamically unstable.<reference-link status="new" type="article" target="../reference/_448422_1502969804219.xml"/> The presence of large amounts of free fluid indicates a need for immediate operative intervention. FAST in haemodynamically stable patients has a less certain impact, as a negative scan does not preclude injury. A large multi-institutional study at paediatric trauma centres demonstrated poor FAST sensitivity (28.6%) in normotensive patients.<reference-link status="new" type="article" target="../reference/_448422_1502970286695.xml"/> Though specificity was high (91.1%), results of FAST rarely changed management. A randomised trial comparing FAST with standard care in haemodynamically stable children and adolescents with blunt torso trauma also found no significant difference in the proportion of abdominal CT scans, missed intra-abdominal injuries, length of stay in the accident and emergency department, and median hospital costs.<reference-link status="new" type="article" target="../reference/_448422_1502970903158.xml"/> Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast is the diagnostic test of choice for the identification of solid organ injuries, especially to the liver, kidney, and/or spleen. Oral contrast is usually not necessary when scanning a patient for trauma. </para>
            <para>Ultrasound is recommended as the first imaging test for suspected appendicitis.<reference-link status="new" type="article" target="../reference/_448422_1502971409186.xml"/> CT with contrast may be appropriate after non-diagnostic ultrasound; however, radiation exposure with its risk of malignancy should be considered. MRI avoids ionising radiation and has similar or better sensitivity and specificity than CT, though availability and longer scan times may limit its utility.<reference-link status="new" type="article" target="../reference/_448422_1502971594627.xml"/>
            </para>
            <para>In general, for investigation of abdominal pain in children, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, with or without contrast, may provide a high yield of information, but radiation exposure should be considered.<reference-link status="new" type="article" target="../reference/_448422_1502979213911.xml"/>
               <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-3.xml"/>
               <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-18.xml"/> Sedation or general anaesthesia may be required in some children. </para>
            <para>GI contrast studies (upper-GI or barium enema studies) are routinely used in place of CT scans, especially in infants. In assessment of intestinal obstruction, clinical suspicion should direct which contrast study should be performed first and will be most informative. <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-8.xml"/>
            </para>
            <para>Endoscopy (oesophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy) with biopsy may be required to assess mucosa-based diseases, such as peptic ulcer disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Rectal biopsy and anorectal manometry help confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. These procedures may be particularly challenging when performed in a newborn.</para>
            <para>Diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia is confirmed by hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan with an ejection fraction &lt;35%. It is important to note that the cut-off of &lt;35% is not universally accepted; some consider an ejection fraction &lt;15% to be more predictive of success of surgical treatment (i.e., cholecystectomy).<reference-link type="article" target="../reference/poc-reference-15185202.xml"/> HIDA scan is also considered a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is considered the most useful method to diagnose a suspected Meckel's diverticulum; this scan identifies ectopic gastric mucosa as tracer is taken up by parietal cells.</para>
            <para>A voiding cystourethrogram is indicated when vesicoureteral reflux is suspected (recurrent UTIs, some say UTI with fever, suggesting higher urinary tract involvement).</para>
            <para>Full skeletal x-rays (skeletal survey) identify previous skeletal injuries and should be obtained if there is a high suspicion of non-accidental trauma. This should only be performed to provide adjunctive diagnoses to support an initial injury and suspicion of abuse.</para>
            <para>Diagnostic laparoscopy may be necessary to confirm diagnosis of PID as it allows direct visualisation of the gynaecological and abdominal structures.</para>

               <para>Certain features are important to note when assessing a patient with suspected cholecystitis including the presence or absence of gallstones and/or sludge; <figure-link inline="false" target="../monograph-figures/787-16.xml"/> the absence of gallstones in a patient with a history suggestive of cholecystitis may be indicative of biliary dyskinesia. In addition, gallbladder wall thickness: thickened gallbladder wall is suggestive of inflammation. Pericholecystic fluid refers to the presence of fluid around the gallbladder and is suggestive of acute inflammation. The absence of fluid in the presence of gallstones and/or gallbladder wall thickening is suggestive of chronic cholecystitis or biliary colic. Sonographic Murphy's sign refers to the presence of Murphy's sign with sonographic compression of the gallbladder and is suggestive of acute inflammation of the gallbladder.</para>

               <para>Lipase is more sensitive (50% to 99%) and specific (86% to 100%) than amylase; however, the utility is limited in acute pancreatitis due to discrepancies in measurement method, patient selection, and cut-off point. Hence, the determination of lipase is not necessary in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and 3 times the normal value of serum amylase. Its use can be helpful in patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of pancreatitis and normal amylase. Due to additional cost and lack of benefit in the majority of patients, utilising serum lipase in conjunction with serum amylase is considered inappropriate.<reference-link type="article" target="../reference/poc-reference-10905786.xml"/>

Power Doppler is up to 5 times more sensitive to blood flow than regular colour Doppler, and is the mode of choice to pick up slow-moving blood such as is seen in ovaries and testicles.<reference-link type="article" target="../reference/poc-reference-15301848.xml"/>

               <para>With trained personnel, bedside pelvic ultrasound is a fast, reliable method to assess for ectopic pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasound may be used to assess for intrauterine pregnancy.</para>
               <para>An ectopic pregnancy may be characterised by an echogenic, cyst-like structure outside the uterus. Several ultrasound findings may be associated with early ectopic pregnancy such as tubal ring, extrauterine mass, extrauterine empty gestational sac, and haemosalpinx.</para>
